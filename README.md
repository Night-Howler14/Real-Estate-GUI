# Real Estate Management System-GUI
We made a real estate GUI using python language (Tkinter)
We made 2 interfaces that are :-
a>  The real estage agentâ€™s office, to get 1) sales reports for each agent, consisting of the sale dates, property details
and selling price and 2) how many properties have been given on rent by each agent for what amount, in
which area, when.
b>  Agents, to update the database when a property is rented or sold.



There are total 3 folders
1. DB --- contains the database which i used in my project (first insert the code in the local host)

2. Code --- contains the codes for the GUI using python language(tkitner)

3. Image folder contains visual that are used in the project
